##User Stories:
* As a user, when I open the application I can see a home page that gives me options to choose the city that I am interested in or use the search bar for that purpose, sign up and log in.
* As a user in order to log in or sign up I need to fill in the user form that requires some basic information like my name, email and password.
* As a user when I am logged in I can choose the city and see the list of cool places that have specials or happy hours in this area, 
* As a user, I realize that if the name of the place is in that list, it means people already posted their experiences.
* As a user, I am able to create a post, add  description, time and specials. However, I have to be either logged in or signed up.
* As a user, I can update or delete my post. 

##Future Development
